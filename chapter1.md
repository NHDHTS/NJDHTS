Text Searchable Elements by Field Below is a list of the searchable elements in the Roads Module, and in many cases the workbooks. Included are brief descriptions of each variable, how it was collected \(if applicable\), and a comprehensive list of all variable values. 

 

Additional information and definitions for each of the crash data elements can be found in the NJTR-1 Crash Report Manual at: http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/pdf/NJTR1CrashReportManual12517.pdf 

 

Alcohol Involved – Should show crashes where at least one person involved was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash.  This includes drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians. Vehicle occupants other than the driver are not part of this definition. This field is identical to the Crash Characteristics field where “Alcohol” is cited, and it is recommended to use the Crash Characteristics field for the most efficient searches. • 1 – \(Yes\) • 0 – \(No\) 

 

Alcohol - Should show crashes where at least one person involved was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash.  This includes drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians. Vehicle occupants other than the driver are not part of this definition. This field is identical to the Alcohol Involved field. • Alcohol Related • Non-Alcohol Related 

 

Bicyclist Involved – Shows crashes where at least one cyclist was involved in the crash. This field is identical to the Contributing Circumstance field where “Bicyclist” is cited and derived for analysis convenience. This field is identical to the Crash Characteristics field where “Bicyclist” is cited, and it is recommended to use the Crash Characteristics field for the most efficient searches. • 1 – \(Yes\) • 0 – \(No\)

# Quick Start Guide

### Roads Module

This is the default module that loads when logged in to the CAT. Beginner users should stick to this Roads module for quick and intuitive crash data querying and analysis. Data in this module is all aggregated at the crash level, so it can answer quesions such as the following.

> When and where did the **crash** occur?
>
> Was alcohol or drugs involved in the **crash**? .
>
> What was the highest level of injury severity in the **crash**?
>
> Were any pedestrians involved in the **crash**?

### Safe Routes to School

##### To see an example workflow using the Roads Module to make a Safe Routes to School pedestrian crash map, check out the [Safe Routes to School](https://thomashillman.gitbooks.io/njdhts-cat/chapter1/safe-routes-to-school.md) page.

#### Extra Credit: Numetric Workbooks

###### For more advanced querying options, check out the [Numetric Workbooks \(Advanced\) ](/numetric-workbooks.md)page.

###### Advanced querying options allow users to answer the following questions:

> How many pedetrians and bicyclists were under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of a crash?
>
> How many occupants in the back seat were not wearing seatbelts?
>
> How many fatal crashes and fatalities were there in a given year?
>
> Of those fatalities, how many were not wearing a seatbelt?

# How to Use the Crash Analysis Tool

### CAT Modules {#cat-modules}

The first step in a workflow using the CAT is to select which data portal \(module\) to use. By default, the Roads module loads when a user logs in to the system, so most users won't need to do anything for this step. Roads provides detailed crash information, and is more than sufficient for beginning users.

##### To get started quickly with basic crash analysis, skip ahead to the [**Filtering Crashes**](https://thomashillman.gitbooks.io/njdhts-cat/chapter1/chapter1/filtering-crashes.md) page. {#to-get-started-quickly-with-basic-crash-analysis-skip-ahead-to-the-filtering-crashes-page}

#### Roads Module {#roads-module}

This is the default module that loads when logged in to the CAT. Beginner users should stick to this Roads module for quick and intuitive crash data querying and analysis. Data in this module is all aggregated \(related\) to the crash table for analyses based on the crash event itself \(for example: "When and where did the **crash** occur? Was alcohol or drugs involved in the **crash**? What was the highest level of injury severity in the **crash**? Were any pedestrians involved in the **crash**?\).

An example workflow using the Roads Module is provided in the [Safe Routes to School](https://thomashillman.gitbooks.io/njdhts-cat/chapter1/safe-routes-to-school.md) section.

#### New Jersey Crash Database Tables \(eg. Driver, Occupant, Pedestrian details\) {#new-jersey-crash-database-tables-eg-driver-occupant-pedestrian-details}

In addition to information about the crash event \(what's presented in the Roads module\) \(eg. crash date and time, municipality, crash severity\), the New Jersey Crash Database also contains information about other important aspects from the NJTR-1 crash form that are _related_ to each crash event. These are categorized into the following tables:

* Drivers
* Occupants
* Pedestrians and Bicyclists
* Vehicles

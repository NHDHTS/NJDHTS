# Quick Start Guide

### Default Module \(Roads\) {#cat-modules}

The first step in a workflow using the CAT is to select which data portal \(module\) to use. By default, the Roads module loads when a user logs in to the system, so most users won't need to do anything for this step. Roads provides detailed crash information, and is more than sufficient for beginning users.

#### Roads Module {#roads-module}

This is the default module that loads when logged in to the CAT. Beginner users should stick to this Roads module for quick and intuitive crash data querying and analysis. Data in this module is all aggregated \(related\) to the crash table for analyses based on the crash event itself \(for example: "When and where did the **crash** occur? Was alcohol or drugs involved in the **crash**? What was the highest level of injury severity in the **crash**? Were any pedestrians involved in the **crash**?\).

**To get started quickly with basic crash analysis, proceed to the **[**Filtering Crashes**](https://thomashillman.gitbooks.io/njdhts-cat/chapter1/chapter1/filtering-crashes.md)** page.**

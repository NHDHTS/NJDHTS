# Numetric Workbooks Module \(Advanced\)

## NJ Statewide Crash Database

In addition to information about the crash event \(covered in the [Quick Start Guide](/chapter1.md) to the Roads module\) \(for example: crash date and time, municipality where the crash occurred, severity of the crash\), the New Jersey Crash Database also contains information about other important aspects from the NJTR-1 crash form that are separate units of analysis. These are captured in the following tables:

* Drivers
* Occupants
* Pedestrians and Bicyclists
* Vehicles

For more information on how to query these aspects, follow the [NJ Statewide Crash Database](/numetric-workbooks/new-jersey-advanced-crash-tables.md) tutorial.

## NJ State Police Fatal Crash Database

Although the complete statewide crash database is useful for many analyses because of its comprehensive nature, for fatality analyses it is not ideal. In recent years, the number of fatalities reported in the statewide crash database has not been accurate \(including some duplicate records, and missing fatal records in other cases\). Since fatal crashes are relatively rare, accurate reporting of these crashes is essential.

The New Jersey State Police maintains its own separate database of all fatal crashes in New Jersey and reports these crashes to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \(NHTSA\)'s Fatal Accident Reporting System \(FARS\). In partnership with the State Police, we have provided access to this database through the Numetric Workbooks module of the CAT. The database is structured into three tables:

* Crashes
* Involved
* Vehicles

For more information on how to query these aspects, follow the [NJSP Fatals Database](/numetric-workbooks/njsp-fatal-database.md) tutorial.

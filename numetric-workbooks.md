## Advanced Crash Tables \(eg. Driver, Occupant, Pedestrian, and Vehicle tables\)

In addition to information about the crash event \(covered in the [Quick Start Guide](/chapter1.md) to the Roads module\) \(for example: crash date and time, municipality where the crash occurred, worst injury in the crash\), the New Jersey Crash Database also contains information about other important aspects from the NJTR-1 crash form that are separate units of analysis. These are categorized into the following tables:

* Drivers
* Occupants
* Pedestrians and Bicyclists
* Vehicles

## New Jersey State Police Fatal Crash Database 

Although the complete statewide crash database is useful for many analyses because of its comprehensive nature, for other analyses it is not ideal. In recent years, the number of fatalities reported in the statewide crash database has not been accurate \(including some duplicate records, and missing fatal records in other cases\). Since fatal crashes are so rare, accurate reporting of these crashes to track trends is essential. 

The New Jersey State Police maintains its own database of all fatal crashes in New Jersey, and reports these crashes to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \(NHTSA\)'s Fatal Accident Reporting System \(FARS\). In partnership with the State Police, we have provided access to this database for accurate and timely querying of fatal crashes. The database is structured into three tables:

| Table | Contents |
| :--- | :--- |
| Crashes | Basic crash information |
| Involved | All Drivers. Deceased only: occupants, pedestrians, or bicyclists |
| Vehicles | Vehicle information |

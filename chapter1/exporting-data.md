# Exporting Data Basics

To export the a table from the CAT as a .csv file \(for use in excel, Google MyMaps, ArcGIS, etc.\) do the following:

1. Ensure you have the data filtered to only what is relevant for your analysis. For further help on how to filter data, follow the [**Querying Crashes**](/chapter1/filtering-crashes.md)** **tutorial.

2. Once your data is queried, to export click on the "Table" tab \(in the top middle of the screen, under the filter bar\) and at the bottom left, select the columns of data you want available in your exported table. Some examples of commonly useful columns include: Common Columns for Export

   | Pedestrian Involved |
   | :--- |
   | Bicyclist Involved |
   | Alcohol Involved |
   | Drugged Driving Involved |
   | Unsafe Speed Involved |
   | Crash Location \(street where crash occurred\) |
   | GPS Coordinates |

3. Make sure to include GPS cooridnates if you'll be making a map:

    "XWGSLong" and "YWGSLat" are selected for export by default, and work for use in Google My Maps. Select the "X" and "Y" columns instead if using ArcMap.

4. Click the CSV download arrow to download the .csv file of each crash indicdent \(row\) that fits your query, with the crash attributes \(columns\) you selected for analysis or map display.

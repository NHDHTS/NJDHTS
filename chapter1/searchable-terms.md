# Filterable Attributes

In order to find the data you're looking for in the CAT you'll need to know what information to search for.

For help on the mechanics of how to use crash filters, review the [Filtering Crashes](/chapter1/filtering-crashes.md) tutorial.

### New Jersey Crash Records

All crash records in the Crash Analysis Tool are sourced from police reports filed at the scene of reportable motor vehicle crashes in New Jersey. By statute, as of this writing, police departments across New Jersey are obligated to complete and submit to the state crash database an NJTR-1 crash report form under the following circumstances:

* Any injury or at least $500 of property damage
* Officer investigated at the crash scene
* Crash occurred on a public or private roadway

**Note that this reporting requirement excludes the following crash examples, which therefore are not captured in the database:**

* Crashes where the police were not notified
* Crashes that were self-reported after the fact \(where an officer was not called to the scene\)
* Crashes not involving a motor vehicle \(eg. train-pedestrian, pedestrian-bike\)
* Crashes not occurring on a roadway \(eg. off-road vehicle crashed in the woods\)

#### NJTR-1 Manual

Formal information and definitions for each of the crash data elements \(variables\) and their attributes \(values\) can be found in the NJTR-1 Crash Report Manual at: [http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/pdf/NJTR1CrashReportManual12517.pdf](http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/pdf/NJTR1CrashReportManual12517.pdf)

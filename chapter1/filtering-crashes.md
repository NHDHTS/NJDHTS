# Querying Crashes

Querying, or filtering, is the first step in a crash analysis, reducing the entire crash database \(over 3 million crashes since 2006\) to a manageable dataset for your analysis.

The way you filter will depend on what information, or values, you're looking for, and the scope of your analysis.

We'll review how to filter using the default Roads module that loads after you log in to the CAT. 

In our examples below, we'll search for crashes in New Brunswick, between the years of 2011 and 2016, where there were one or more pedestrians involved.

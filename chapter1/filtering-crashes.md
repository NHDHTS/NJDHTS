# Querying Crashes

Querying, or _filtering_, is the first step in a crash analysis, reducing the entire database \(over 3 million crashes since 2006\) to a manageable set of records for your analysis.

The way you filter will depend on what information, or values, you're looking for, and the scope of your analysis.

We'll review how to filter using the default Roads module that loads after you log in to the CAT.

## Filtering Methods

Let's take the folloiwng example: What are the details of crashes in the municipality of New Brunswick, between the years of 2011 and 2016, with pedestrians involved?

#### Interactive Charts & Graphs

The most intuitive way to filter crashes is by clicking on the interactive charts and graphs found throughout the Crash Analysis Tool. All charts will automatically adjust their totals based on the filters you apply. Chart and graphs provide totals based on the underlying data table \(they are not limited to "geocoded" crashes, or those with X and Y coordinates included\).



#### Filter Bar

The filter bar allows for precise querying of the crash data 

#### Route Filter

Any crash that occurred along a numbered route can be filtered based on that route number. In addition, if you know the mileposts you're interested in searching, you can specify those as well. 

The following video gives an overview of route filtering using Numetric. Note that New Jersey routes can be searched by their number directly: for example, for Interstate 295, simply type the number 295, or for County Road 518, simply type 518. Below is an informational video introduction to route filtering.

### Spatial Filter

Spatial filters allow you to analyze crashes visually at an intersection or along a stretch of road. Because spatial filters are map-based, they only capture those crashes that have geocoded crash information \(currently approximately 70% of all crashes\). Below is a quick tutorial video on how to use a spatial filter. Note that currently spatial filters can only create square boxes, although abnormal polygon based selection is coming in a future Numetric release.

### Save and Share a Query

Now that you've spent some time filtering just the crashes you want for your analysis, let's make sure you can come back and find those same crashes in the future, or share them with a colleague.

To save a query, simply click the "Save" button beside the top filter bar:

Once you've saved a query, to share it, simply click the share icon![](/assets/share_icon_4.png)on the right hand side of the screen at the top \(just below your user name:

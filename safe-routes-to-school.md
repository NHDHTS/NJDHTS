# Safe Routes to School Crash Maps

Looking for a user-friendly way to make crash maps for your Safe Routes to School Travel Plans? The DHTS CAT has built-in features that make this a snap.

## Step 1 - Log in to the CAT

Main portal: [**http://njdhts.numetric.com**](http://njdhts.numetric.com)

## Step 2 - Filter the Data

Apply filters to query relevant crashes for your travel plan. Example: Municipality \(eg. "New Brunswick"\).

For more help using filters, check out the [**Filtering Crashes**](/chapter1/filtering-crashes.md) page.

## Step 3 - Export from the CAT

Export the crash table as a .csv file

* Click on the "Table" tab, and at the bottom left, select the columns of data you want available in your Safe Routes to School Travel Plan Map. Some examples of useful columns could include:

  * Crash Date
  * Pedestrian Involved
  * Bicycle Involved
  * Alcohol Involved
  * Unsafe Speed Involved

  Make sure to include GPS cooridnates for the map:

  * "Xwgslong" and "Ywgslat" columns are selected to export by default. These are your GPS coordinates for use in Google My Maps.

* Click the CSV download arrow to download the .csv file of each crash indicdent \(row\) that fits your query, with the crash attributes \(columns\) you selected for analysis or map display.

For more help on exporting data, check out the [**Exporting Data**](/chapter1/exporting-data.md) page.

## Step 4 - Import into Google My Maps

1. Navigate your web browser to mymaps.google.com and log in with your google account \(or make one if necessary\).
2. Create a new map.
3. Import the CSV file containing your crash data from the CAT.
4. Select Xwgslong and Ywgslat for the location columns.
5. Select your display variable \(we are using severity in this exaple\)
6. Style your new custom crash map to your liking. \(eg. marker colors, title, etc.\)

That's it! Enjoy and present your new custom SRTS crash map to your stakeholders.

# Safe Routes to School Crash Mapping

Looking for a user-friendly way to make crash maps for your Safe Routes to School Travel Plans? The DHTS CAT has built-in features that make this a snap.

## Step 1 - Log in to the CAT

Main portal: [**http://njdhts.numetric.com**](http://njdhts.numetric.com)

For more help logging in, check out the** **[**Logging In **](/chapter1/logging-in.md)page.

## Step 2 - Filter the Data

Apply filters to query relevant crashes for your travel plan. Example: Municipality \(eg. "Highland Park"\).

For more help using filters, check out the [**Filtering Crashes**](/chapter1/filtering-crashes.md) page.

## Step 3 - Export

Export the crash table as a .csv file

* Click on the "Table" tab, and at the bottom left, select the columns of data you want available in your Safe Routes to School Travel Plan Map. Some examples of useful columns could include:

  * Crash Date
  * Pedestrian Involved
  * Bicycle Involved
  * Alcohol Involved
  * Unsafe Speed Involved

  Make sure to include GPS cooridnates for the map:

  * "Xwgslong" and "Ywgslat" columns are selected to export by default. These are your GPS coordinates for use in Google My Maps.

* Click the CSV download arrow to download the .csv file of each crash indicdent \(row\) that fits your query, with the crash attributes \(columns\) you selected for analysis or map display.

For more help on exporting data, check out the [**Exporting Data**](/chapter1/exporting-data.md) page.

## Step 4 - Import into Google My Maps

Navigate your web browser to mymaps.google.com and log in with your google account \(or make one if necessary\).

##### Click "Create New Map" and Import the CSV file containing your crash data

## Step 5 - Don't stop there, add your own layers too!

How about adding a sidewalk inventory you collect with parents?

Why not crowdsource some photos from PTA members to who know of needed infrastructure improvements? Are there "cow paths" to indicate sidewalk desire lines, misaligned intersections, high speed traffic streets for traffic calming, or missing crosswalks/curb cuts in your town?

You can easily add all this to your interactive Google My Map. It's easy to draw new points and lines on the map and upload photos. Best of all, the map is interactive and shareable.

## Step 6 - Enjoy your Interactive SRTS Map!

That's it! Present your new custom SRTS crash map to your stakeholders and work with them to identify improvements.

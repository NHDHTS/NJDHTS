# New Jersey Crash Reporting

All crash records in the Crash Analysis Tool are sourced from police reports filed at the scene of reportable motor vehicle crashes in New Jersey. By statute, as of this writing, police departments across New Jersey are obligated to complete and submit to the State an NJTR-1 crash report form under the following circumstances:

* Police were called to the scene
* Any injury or at least $500 of property damage occurred
* Crash occurred on a public or private roadway

**Note that this reporting requirement excludes the following crash examples, which are not captured in the state database:**

* Crashes where the police were not notified
* Crashes that were self-reported after the fact \(where an officer was not called to the scene\)
* Crashes not involving a motor vehicle \(eg. train-pedestrian, pedestrian-bike\)
* Crashes not occurring on a roadway \(eg. off-road vehicles, off-road construction sites\)

## NJTR-1 Manual

# New Jersey Crash Reporting Procedures

This is all great, but what crashes are included in the databases?

All crash records in the Crash Analysis Tool are sourced from police reports filed at the scene of reportable motor vehicle crashes in New Jersey. By statute, as of this writing, police departments across New Jersey are obligated to complete and submit to the State an NJTR-1 crash report form under the following circumstances:

* Any injury or at least $500 of property damage occurred
* An officer was called to the scene
* Crash occurred on a public or private roadway

**Note that these reporting requirements exclude the following crash types, which are therefore not captured in the statewide database:**

* Crashes where the police were not notified
* Crashes that were self-reported after the fact \(where an officer was not called to the scene\)
* Crashes not involving a motor vehicle \(eg. train-pedestrian, pedestrian-bike\)
* Crashes not occurring on a roadway \(eg. off-road vehicles, off-road construction sites\)

Additionally, the **NJSP Fatal Crash Database** consists of the following subset of all reported crashes:

* Crash resulted in at least one fatality within 30 days of the crash
* Database includes information for all Crash events and all Drivers involved
* Only Pedestrians, Bicyclists, or other vehicle Occupants who were **killed** as a result of the crash are recorded in the fatal crash database \(those who were involved but not killed are not included\)

## NJTR-1 Manual

Formal information and definitions for each of the crash data elements \(also called variables, or columns\) and their attributes \(the values for each case, captured in a row\) can be found in the NJTR-1 Crash Report Manual at: [http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/pdf/NJTR1CrashReportManual12517.pdf](http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/pdf/NJTR1CrashReportManual12517.pdf)

# Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in better understanding crash data to improve roadway safety. The New Jersey Division of Highway and Traffic Safety Crash Analysis Tool is designed to help you identify crash/fatality/injury patterns relevant to your project or jurisdiction, and use this information to improve the roadway and behavioral conditions in your area.

Behaviors and attitudes have a large impat on highway safety, and crashes arise from a complex combination of driver, passenger, pedestrian, and environmental factors, which you can explore using this tool, and use to develop and refine countermeasures to deter unsafe behaviors and promote safe alternatives.

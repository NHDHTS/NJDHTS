# Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in better understanding crash data to improve roadway safety. The New Jersey Division of Highway Traffic Safety [Crash Analysis Tool](http://njdhts.numetric.com) is designed to help you identify crash, injury, and fatality patterns relevant to your project or jurisdiction, and use this information to improve the roadway and behavioral conditions in your area.

Behaviors and attitudes have a large impact on highway safety. Crashes \(and their consequences\) arise from a complex combination of driver, passenger, pedestrian, and bicyclist factors, as well as infrastructural and environmental conditions, all of which you can explore using this tool. The results of your exploration can  be used to develop and refine countermeasures to deter unsafe behaviors and promote safe alternatives.

Here are some tips and how-to guides to help you make the most of the NJ DHTS [Crash Analysis Tool](http://njdhts.numetric.com).

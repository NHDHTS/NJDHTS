Once inside, select one of the four New Jersey Statewide Crash Database workbooks based on your table of primary interest:

* To count pedestrians and bicyclists, select the Pedestrians and Bicyclists workbook.
* To count drivers, select the Drivers workbook. 
* To count occupants \(including the driver\), click the Occupants workbook. 
* To count vehicles, click on the Vehicles workbook. 

The mechanics of querying and exporting data from the New Jersey Statewide Crash Database are the same as for all other CAT modules. See the [**Querying Crashes **](/chapter1/filtering-crashes.md)and [**Exporting Data**](/chapter1/exporting-data.md) pages for further information about those features.

The underlying data and design of the New Jersey Statewide Crash Database workbooks, as well as a list of searchable terms in the NJSP Fatal Crash Database, are different from the NSP Fatal Crash Database workbooks and the Roads module. Below are details about the underlying data in the New Jersey Statewide Crash Database and examples of questions and outputs from the workbooks.

## Pedestrians and Bicyclists

The Pedestrians and Bicyclists workbook uses the New Jersey Statewide Crash Database Pedestrian and Bicyclist table as a base table. As a result, all charts, graphs, tables, and totals reflect a count of **pedestrians and/or bicyclists** involved in crashes. Some examples of questions that could be answered using the Pedestrians and Bicyclists workbook are the following:

> Of the **bicyclists **involved in crashes, how many were under the influence of alcohol or drugs?
>
> Are **pedestrians **under 18 or over 65 involved in a high percentage of crashes in my municipality?
>
> What percentage of seriously injured **pedestrians **had their crash at an intersection versus a non-intersection?

Bear in mind that the Pedestrian and Bicyclist workbook joins the crash table to the pedestrian and bicyclist table. As a result, counts and totals from this workbook will be structured as follows:

\# of **pedestrians and/or bicyclists** in crashes with a particular crash attribute \(eg. municipality, year, time of day, route\)

\# of** pedestrians and/or bicyclists** with a particular pedestrian/bicyclist attribute \(eg. BAC level range, age, pedestrian/bicyclist contributing circumstances\)

## [Drivers](https://cloud.numetric.com/workbooks#/report2/0c8fa685-88d0-48d1-8355-36653e2bf64d)

The [**Drivers** ](https://cloud.numetric.com/workbooks#/report2/0c8fa685-88d0-48d1-8355-36653e2bf64d)workbook uses the New Jersey Statewide Crash Database Driver table as a base table. As a result, all charts, graphs, tables, and totals reflect a count of **drivers** involved in crashes. Some examples of questions that could be answered using the Drivers workbook are the following:

> Of the **drivers **involved in crashes aged 16-20, how many were under the influence of alcohol or drugs?
>
> Are **drivers** over 65 involved in a high percentage of crashes in my municipality?
>
> What percentage of seriously injured **drivers **crashed at an intersection versus a non-intersection?

Bear in mind that the [**Drivers** ](https://cloud.numetric.com/workbooks#/report2/0c8fa685-88d0-48d1-8355-36653e2bf64d)workbook joins the crash table to the pedestrian and driver table. As a result, counts and totals from this workbook will be structured as follows:

\# of **drivers** in crashes with a particular crash attribute \(eg. municipality, year, time of day, route\)

\# of** drivers** with a particular driver attribute \(eg. BAC level range, age, driver contributing circumstances\)

## Occupants

The Drivers workbook uses the New Jersey Statewide Crash Database Driver table as a base table. As a result, all charts, graphs, tables, and totals reflect a count of **drivers** involved in crashes. Some examples of questions that could be answered using the Drivers workbook are the following:

> How many unbelted **occupants **were in the front seat versus the back seat?
>
> Of the **drivers **involved in crashes aged 16-20, how many were under the influence of alcohol or drugs?
>
> Are **drivers** over 65 involved in a high percentage of crashes in my municipality?
>
> What percentage of seriously injured **drivers **crashed at an intersection versus a non-intersection?

Bear in mind that the Drivers workbook joins the crash table to the pedestrian and driver table. As a result, counts and totals from this workbook will be structured as follows:

\# of **drivers** in crashes with a particular crash attribute \(eg. municipality, year, time of day, route\)

\# of** drivers** with a particular driver attribute \(eg. BAC level range, age, driver contributing circumstances\)

### Filterable Attributes

A list of attributes that can be used to filter the crash data presented in the _NJ Statewide Crash Database_ advanced Numetric Workbooks has been compiled and will be added soon to this tutorial. Included are brief descriptions of each attribute, how it was collected \(if applicable\), and a comprehensive list of all variable values.
